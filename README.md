# Creation of an objective function for the RNA folding problem
## Aim of this repository

This repository has been created to answer this question For a given ribonucleotide chain, the RNA folding problem consists in finding the native fold among the astronomically large number of possible conformations. The native fold being the one with the lowest Gibbs free energy, the objective function should be an estimator of this energy.

## Method 

To accomplish the objective, a statistical training of an objective function will be performed using the frequency distribution of distances associated with the C3 atom of nucleotides in a training set (n=10 base pairs).

We consider the following base pairs : AA, AU, AC, AG, UU, UC, UG, CC, CG, GG. 
Only C3 atoms, interchain distances and residus separated by at least 3 positions on the sequence are taken into account 
We also consider 30 distance intervals ranging from 1 to 20 Ã…
